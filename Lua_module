	<Lua modules>
	Module is like a library that can be loaded using require and has a single global name containing a table.
	This module can consist of a number of functions and variables.
	All these functions and variables are wrapped in to the table, which acts as a namespace.
	Also, a well behaved module has necessary provisions to retyrn this table on require.

	<Specialty of Lua modules>
	The usage of tables in modules helps us in numerous ways and enables us  to manipulate the modules in the same way we manipluate any other Lua table.
	As a result of the ability to manipulate modules, it provides extra features for which other language need special mechanisms.
	Due to this free mechanism of modules in Lua, a user can call the functions in Lua in multiple ways.
